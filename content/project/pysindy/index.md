PySINDy is an open source Python package [Kathleen Champion](http://www.kathleenchampion.com/) and I created for the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical systems (SINDy).

We designed the package to make the process of learning governing equations from data as painless as possible for practitioners and to provide a standard implementation of the SINDy method for researchers to build upon.
